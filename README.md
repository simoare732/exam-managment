To run the application you have to go into "target" directory and press the file called "tesina-1.0-jar-with-dependencies".

I wrote this application during my Bachelor's degree in computer science.

In this application you can add,modify or remove exams and every of it can be simple (made by a unique test) and complex (made by N tests).
Depending by the filters you put, then you can press the button "Grafico" and it will show you a window with a histogram about the informations in the table in that moment.
