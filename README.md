# exam-managment
An application can help a teacher (university teacher) to save the exams of his students.

To run the application you have to go into "target" directory and press the file called "tesina-1.0-jar-with-dependencies".

I wrote this application during my Bachelor's degree in computer science.

In this application you can add,modify or remove exams and every of it can be simple (made by a unique test) and complex (made by N tests).
Depending by the filters you put, then you can press the button "Grafico" and it will show you a window with a histogram about the informations in the table in that moment.

Then you can save, load or print the table.
In the "doc" directory there is the file index to see the documentation about the program.
